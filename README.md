We ran into a few issues regarding how to view changes committed by others in our local IDE,
we got together as a group and managed to work out how to go about committing changes and 
updating our local files. We also ran into a challenge because of two files attempting
to be committed and we managed to resolve it.

Updated to include:

- Interfaces for Three classes
  - Board
  - Point
  - MovableTetris piece
- Loggers in the SandBox class to replace System.out.print messages
- Warnings in classes resolved and suppressed according to requirements
