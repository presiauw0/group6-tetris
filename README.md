## Sprint 3 Comments
- **Issue 1**: In the TetrisBoardPanel we have a small checkstyle warning in which we have 12 exectuable statments instead of the 10. We will look to fix this in the 3rd sprint.
- **Idea 1**: Khalid would like to tinker around with the round edges that we see in the mac version when playing tetris (just something cosmetic).
- **Code Weirdness 1**: N/A
