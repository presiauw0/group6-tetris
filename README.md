# TCSS305-Group6-Tetris-Sprint3

## Sprint 3 Contribution

- **Abdulrahman Hassan**  - 

- **Khalid Rashid**  - For sprint 3 I prioritized working on the Tetris GUI and visual displays. I modified the layout to create Borders on each panel. I added A new class Called PauseEndPanel that displays An overlayed panel with a message for when the Game is over or paused. I also added an extra credit feature called "Hard Mode". I created a TetrisMenuBuilder class that resolved the "too many Methods" warning but this would require that the TetrisGUI has public methods so this class was removed and is currently within the sp3-Khalid-RefactorTetrisGUI Branch. I also Modified the Menu's in the Tetris GUI to fix all checkstyle warning and added JavaDoc. I created an Interface for the PauseEndPanel as well.

- **Preston Sia**  -
  
- **Balkirat Singh**  - For Sprint 3, I focused on managing the Sprint 3 meetings and implementing sound features for our Tetris game. I organized the meeting sheet and created a README template to keep everything aligned with the submission guidelines. I also added background music as an extra credit feature and introduced a mute/unmute function that can be toggled with the "M" key. Another feature I added was the ability to toggle sound on and off through the options menu on the interface. These updates made the game more user friendly while keeping our work well organized for this sprint. Also I looked thorugh any checkstyles issues we might face.

### Location of Implementation -

### Issues -
- **Issue 1**: 
- **Idea 1**: 
- **Code Weirdness 1**:

**Required Extra Feature**

- JAR File - 

**Extra Credit Features**

- Save Highscore - 
- Ghost Piece -
- Background Music - Added background music to the Tetris game that starts automatically when a new game begins and stops when the game is paused or ends. Implemented functionality where pressing the M key toggles the music on and off, allowing players to control the background music easily.
- Toggle Music ON/OFF - Added an option in the gameâ€™s settings menu that allows players to toggle the background music on and off directly through the interface. This feature provides an additional, user-friendly way to control the music alongside the M key functionality.
- Hard Mode - An option to enter "Hard Mode". This disables the grid Lines and Ghost Piece. It also limits the number of times a user can Rotate a piece to 4 times (achieving a full piece rotation).
