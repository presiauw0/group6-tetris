# TCSS305-Group6-Tetris-Sprint2

## Sprint 2 Contribution

- **Abdulrahman Hassan**  - Worked in updating the GUI to add things such as PropertyChangeListener and Timer that ticks every 500 milliseconds with an ActionListener that calls to the Board.step() method.


- **Khalid Rashid**  -


- **Preston Sia**  -


- **Balkirat Singh**  - I worked on implementing the functionality for the primary model object (Board) by adding a factory method and making sure everything followed the interface defined in the Model. I added a KeyListener to handle piece movement (left, right, down, drop, and rotate), making sure it only interacted with the Board API and didn’t directly change the GUI. I also added a listener to the "New Game" menu button so it resets the Board and starts the timer when selected. I tinkered with checkstyle validation in my branch, though we ultimately decided to go with another group member’s version. On top of that, I recorded the minutes for the first meeting and created the template for the readme.md.
