# TCSS305-Group6-Tetris-Sprint3

## Sprint 3 Contribution

- **Abdulrahman Hassan**  - 

- **Khalid Rashid**  - 

- **Preston Sia**  -
  
- **Balkirat Singh**  - For Sprint 3, I focused on managing the Sprint 3 meetings and implementing sound features for our Tetris game. I organized the meeting sheet and created a README template to keep everything aligned with the submission guidelines. I also added background music as an extra credit feature and introduced a mute/unmute function that can be toggled with the "M" key. Another feature I added was the ability to toggle sound on and off through the options menu on the interface. These updates made the game more user friendly while keeping our work well organized for this sprint. Also I looked thorugh any checkstyles issues we might face.

## Sprint 3 Comments
- **Issue 1**: In the TetrisBoardPanel we have a small checkstyle warning in which we have 12 exectuable statments instead of the 10. We will look to fix this in the 3rd sprint.
- **Idea 1**: Khalid would like to tinker around with the round edges that we see in the mac version when playing tetris (just something cosmetic).
- **Code Weirdness 1**: N/A

- **Required Extra Feature**

- **Extra Credit Feature**
  Background Music - Added background music to the Tetris game that starts automatically when a new game begins and stops when the game is paused or ends. Implemented functionality where pressing the M key toggles the music on and off, allowing players to control the background music easily.
  Toggle Music ON/OFF - Added an option in the gameâ€™s settings menu that allows players to toggle the background music on and off directly through the interface. This feature provides an additional, user-friendly way to control the music alongside the M key functionality.
